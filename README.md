# :book: About this Project

I like to development games because helps me to study Javascript, is fun and I can play them ready. Tetris was part of my childhood, that's why I coded a 
responsive Tetris version. I really enjoyed make this project, because several Javascript functions are needed and I took the opportunity to review concepts.

This project is part of my personal portfolio, so I would appreciate if you provide me any 
feedback about the ideia, code, structure or anything you could report to make me a better developer.

Feel free to use the Tetris as you wish, either to study, make improvementes or play! Have fun!

Open the cloned project in your editor and install a Live Server to launch a development local server with live reload feature. If you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) like me, I recommend to install the extension [LiveServer](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server/blob/master/docs/settings.md).
Then start the live server and open the browser in the port number provided:

```
